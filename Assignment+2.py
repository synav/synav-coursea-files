# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[2]:


# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[1]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[3]:


def answer_one():
     return pd.Series.argmax(df['Gold'])
    
        
answer_one()


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[4]:


def answer_two():
    return pd.Series.argmax((df['Gold'])-(df['Gold.1']))
answer_two()


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[5]:


def answer_three():
    df_n = df[(df['Gold']!=0) & (df['Gold.1']!=0)]
    return pd.Series.argmax(((df_n['Gold'])-(df_n['Gold.1']))/((df_n['Gold'])+(df_n['Gold.1']))) #if df[(df['Gold']!=0) & (df['Gold.1']!=0)]

answer_three()


# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[6]:


def answer_four():
    
    Points=pd.Series(3*df['Gold.2']+2*df['Silver.2']+1*df['Bronze.2'])
    Points.index=df.index
    return Points
answer_four()


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[7]:


census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head(100)


# In[8]:


def answer_five():
    x=census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50]
    y=x.groupby("STNAME") ['COUNTY'].sum() 
    return y.idxmax()
answer_five()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[9]:


def answer_six():
    t=census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50]
    y=t.groupby('STNAME')['CENSUS2010POP'].nlargest(3)
    y=y.unstack()
    z=y.sum(axis=1)
    a=z.sort_values(ascending=False)
    b=a.to_frame()
    c=b.index
    return  [c[0], c[1], c[2]]


answer_six()


# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[10]:


def answer_seven():
    t=census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50]
    columns_to_keep = ['CTYNAME',
                   'POPESTIMATE2010',
                   'POPESTIMATE2011',
                   'POPESTIMATE2012',
                   'POPESTIMATE2013',
                   'POPESTIMATE2014',
                   'POPESTIMATE2015']
    t = t[columns_to_keep]
    t['x']=t.max(axis=1)
    t['y']=t.min(axis=1)
    t['LARGESTCHANGE']=t['x']-t['y']
    z=t.max(axis=0)['LARGESTCHANGE']
    t.index=t['CTYNAME']
    a=t.index[t['LARGESTCHANGE']==z]
    return t.loc[t['LARGESTCHANGE']==z, 'CTYNAME'].item()
answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[29]:


def answer_eight():
    
    a=census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50]
    b=a[a['REGION']<=2]
    columns_to_keep=['STNAME','CTYNAME', 'POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']
    c=b[columns_to_keep]
    county_name=c['CTYNAME'].str.split(' ')
    c['COUNTYNAME']=county_name.str[0]
    d=c[c['COUNTYNAME']=='Washington']
    e=d[d['POPESTIMATE2015']>d['POPESTIMATE2014']]
    columns_to_keep=['STNAME','CTYNAME']
    f=e[columns_to_keep]
    
    return  f.head(5)
